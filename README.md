with around 3.4k stars as of writing this. It's free, is open-source and
features over 300 components across marketing, eCommerce and application UI.

### HyperJS

HyperJS is an open-source collection of Alpine JS components. I built this
project based on the annoyance of having to write duplicate Alpine JS logic for
different projects.

### Hypercolor

Hypercolor is a collection of pre-made gradients created with Tailwind CSS. It
has been extended to provide radial and conic gradients through changes to the
Tailwind CSS config.
